## Exercises
1. Count the number of users, bank accounts and tabulate:
(i) the number of bank accounts for each user
(ii) the number of months of each bank account for which data is available
(iii) the total number of credits (deposits), debits (withdrawals) and their averages per month for each bank account and each customer
(iv) the total dollar value of credits, debits and their averages per month for each bank account and each customer

2. Consider userid: 219154, bank_account_id: 4614  - plot the withdrawals, deposits and daily balance as a daily time series; do the same for userid: 217867, bank_account_id : 5420.
3. For the customers with the above userids, plot the withdrawals, deposits and daily balance as a daily time series (aggregate over all their bank accounts)
4. Find a way to classify debit and credit transactions into a manageable set of sub-categories based on the description of the transaction. What % of each customer’s debit and credit transactions fall within the sub-categories that you have defined? 
5. The cash flow of a business has many dimensions [for example, top 5 deposits/Total deposits,  average # of days between two withdrawals, coefficient of variation of the daily balance] that are potentially relevant to a borrower’s ability to repay. Can you obtain the value of these variables for each customer? What other cash flow variables can you hypothesize that could be relevant for predicting customer default?
